## Description

During this week, I was tasked with building a back end for an e-commerce sute. This was acheieved using a working Express.js API and cofngiuring it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL dtabase. Since the application is not intended to be deployed, I have created a step-by-step video that showcases its features and ensures that all acceptance criteria have been satisfied.
